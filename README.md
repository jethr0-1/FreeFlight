# FreeFlight
FreeFlight v0.1 - Search flights and aircrafts with bash
# Installation
Clone the git repository, initialise freeflight.sh and select install! The process is entirely automated, and the installation script will be updated as new dependencies are required.
# Roadmap
I wish to  continue working on this project in my free time and create new and interesting features. The next feature I plan to implement is a 'Link Generator' module, that generates links to popular flight-tracking sites and registration databases.
