# FreeFlight
FreeFlight v0.1 - Search flights and aircrafts with bash
# Installation
Clone the git repository, initialise freeflight.sh and select install! The process is entirely automated, and the installation script will be updated as new dependencies are required.
# API Key's
Currently, you will need an AviationStack API key to use the flight tracker module. You can obtain this key for free at https://aviationstack.com/signup/free.

Once you have this key, copy and paste it into the 'config.json' file in place of 'YOURAPIKEY'.
# Roadmap
I wish to  continue working on this project in my free time and create new and interesting features. The next feature I plan to implement is a 'Link Generator' module, that generates links to popular flight-tracking sites and registration databases.
